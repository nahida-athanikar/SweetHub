🤖 My AI Usage
We were encouraged to use AI tools transparently  and responsibly throughout this project. I leveraged the following AI tool to enhance my workflow:


AI Tool Used: ChatGPT (OpenAI) 

How I Used It: 
I used ChatGPT for generate several design concepts for the Sweet Shop's web logo. Once a direction was chosen, I used the tool to generate the final logo image, which I then integrated into the frontend application's navigation bar.

I also took help from ChatGPT while working on the header design. It helped me
think through responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens, and
suggested color combinations that work well together. Based on these ideas, I
implemented and fine-tuned the final UI manually.



Impact on Workflow: 
Using AI helped me move past initial design blocks and saved time on UI
decisions. This allowed me to focus more on core development tasks like backend
logic, frontend implementation, and Test-Driven Development (TDD). AI acted as
a helpful assistant, while all final decisions and code were written and
reviewed by me.
