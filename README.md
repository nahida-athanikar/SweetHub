🤖 My AI Usage
We were encouraged to use AI tools transparently  and responsibly throughout this project. I leveraged the following AI tool to enhance my workflow:


AI Tool Used: ChatGPT (OpenAI) 

How I Used It: I used ChatGPT to brainstorm and generate several design concepts for the Sweet Shop's web logo. Once a direction was chosen, I used the tool to generate the final logo image, which I then integrated into the frontend application's navigation bar.

Impact on Workflow: This task allowed me to quickly bypass the initial creative block associated with graphic design. By offloading the logo creation to AI, I was able to dedicate more time to the core requirements of the Kata, such as implementing the backend API and focusing on Test-Driven Development (TDD). This accelerated the initial setup phase.
