## 🤖 My AI Usage

We were encouraged to use AI tools transparently and responsibly throughout this project. I leveraged the following AI tool to enhance my workflow:

**AI Tool Used:** ChatGPT (OpenAI)

### How I Used It:

* Used ChatGPT to generate and brainstorm multiple **logo and UI design concepts** for the SweetHub application.
* Took guidance for **responsive header and navigation bar layouts** for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
* Used AI suggestions to explore **color palettes and UI consistency**, then implemented the final design manually.
* Took help while **debugging UI issues**, structuring React components, and understanding best practices for frontend architecture.
* Used ChatGPT for **backend debugging support during TDD**, especially when resolving failing tests and edge cases.

### Impact on Workflow:

Using AI helped me overcome initial design blocks and reduced time spent on repetitive problem-solving. This allowed me to focus more on:

* Core backend logic
* Frontend feature implementation
* Writing and fixing test cases using TDD

AI acted strictly as an **assistant**, while all architectural decisions, implementations, testing, and final code were **written, verified, and reviewed by me**.

## 📌 Notes for HR 

* This project follows **industry-level coding standards**.
* Commit history reflects **TDD workflow** and incremental development.
* AI usage is fully transparent and compliant with project guidelines.
